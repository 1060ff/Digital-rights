^[[1]](#cite_note-1)^

It's best not to visit your own personal website where either real names
or pseudonyms (which have ever been tied to a non-Tor connection/IP) are
attached. 
- 最好不要访问你的个人网站，不管你是用真名还是假名（即曾经通过非Tor IP连接过的用户）。
Because how many people are visiting your personal website?
- 因为能有多少人访问你的个人网站呢？
90% of all Tor users, or just you, or just very few other people? That's
weak anonymity. 
- 90%的所有Tor使用者，还是只有你，还是只是很少一部分人？那就是很弱的匿名了。
Once you visit a website your Tor circuit gets dirty.
- 一旦你访问了一个网站，你所使用的Tor回路就没之前的“干净”了。
The exit relay knows that someone visited your website and if the site
is not that popular, it's a good guess that 'someone' was you. It
wouldn't be hard to assume that further connections originating from
that exit relay come from your machine.
- 出口节点知道有人访问了你的网站，如果网站访问不大，那就很好猜那个访问者就是你。进而也就不难预设从这个出口节点发出的连接是来自你的机器了。

Login into your real life Facebook account and think you are anonymous.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Login into your real life Facebook account and think you are anonymous.")]
登錄了你的Facebook（或微博/微信等反映你真實社交關係的）賬戶，還以爲你是在匿名（？）
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't login into your personal Facebook account. No matter if your real
name is attached or only a pseudonym. You most likely added your friends
and they know who the account belongs to. Through your social network
Facebook can guess who you are.
不要登錄到你的個人帳號（如臉書，微博等），不管你的帳號是用的實名還是假名。通常你加了一些好友而他們知道這個號是誰的。通過社交帳號別人基本能猜到你是誰。（MDrights補充：現在社交帳號通常都綁定了手機號，更做不到匿名了，用別人的手機號也是徒勞的）

No anonymity solution is magic. Online anonymity software may reliably
hide your IP/location. But Facebook does not need your IP/location. They
already know who you are, who your friends are, which private messages
you send and so on. All those data is at least stored on Facebook's
server. No kind of software can delete that data. Only Facebook and
crackers could.
沒有一種匿名方案是一勞永逸的。在線匿名軟件會可靠地隱匿你的IP/物理位置。但臉書等（社交帳號）並不需要知道你的IP/位置，他們已經知道你是誰，你的朋友是誰，你發了哪條私信，等等。這些數據都至少會存儲在臉書（社交帳號）的服務器上。沒有任何軟件可以刪除這些數據，只有臉書自己和破壞者可以做到。

So if you log into your personal Facebook account you only get location
privacy. No anonymity.
所以如果你（用匿名技術）登錄了你的臉書（社交帳號）你得到的只是物理位置的隱匿，不是真正意義的匿名。

Never login into accounts you ever used without Tor.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Never login into accounts you ever used without Tor.")]
千萬別（在匿名狀態時）登錄你平時不用Tor登錄的帳號
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Always assume that each time you visit a website, that they will log the
IP/location which visited the website, at which time and what you did.
應該總是預設每次你訪問一個網站時，網站都會記錄你的IP/位置，並且記錄時間，和你所做的事情。

Also assume, that each time you're online your ISP (Internet Service
Provider) will log your online time, IP/location and perhaps traffic.
還要把這件事也裝在腦子裏：每次你在線時你的ISP（互聯網服務商）都會記錄你的在線時間、IP/位置甚至流量。

Your ISP could also log to which IPs/locations you connected, how much
traffic and what you send and retrieved. (Unless it's encrypted, then
they'll see only garbage.) The following tables should give you an
simplified overview what those logs could look like.
你的ISP也會記錄你要連接的IP/位置，有多少流量，以及你發送/接受了什麼。（除非你加密了你的流量，ISP看到的就是一堆垃圾。）下面這個表格能給你個簡單的對ISP記錄的認識。

You'll see, when websites and ISP keep logs, no one needs Sherlock
Holmes to conclude.

If you mess up for one time, and login with a non-Tor connection/IP,
which can be tied to you, then the whole account is compromised.

Don't login into your bank account, paypal, ebay or other important personal accounts unless...[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Don't login into your bank account, paypal, ebay or other important personal accounts unless...")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logging into your bank, paypal, ebay or other important personal
accounts registered on your name where money is involved could risk,
that your account gets suspended, due to "suspicious activity" by the
fraud prevention system. This is because crackers sometimes use Tor for
committing fraud. That's probably not what you want.

It's not anonymous for reasons already explained. It's pseudonymous and
offers circumvention (in case access to the site is blocked by your ISP)
and location privacy. The difference of anonymity and pseudonymity is
covered in a later chapter on this page.

In many cases you will be able to contact the support and to get your
account unblocked again or on request, even the fraud protection policy
gets relaxed for your account.

Whonix developer adrelanos is not against using Tor for circumvention
and/or location privacy, you just should know the risk of your account
getting (temporarily) suspended and the other things mentioned on this
page and the other warnings from the Whonix documentation. So if you
know what you are doing, feel free.

Don't alternate Tor with open WiFi.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Don't alternate Tor with open WiFi.")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may think open WiFi is faster and equally safe as Tor since the
IP/location cannot be tied to your real name, right?

It's better to use an open WiFi *AND* Tor, but not an open WiFi *OR*
Tor.

The approximate location of any IP address can be tied down to a city,
region or even a street. Even if you are away, you still gave away your
city or approximate location since most people don't switch continents.

You don't know who is running the open WiFi router or their policies.
They could be keeping logs of your MAC address and tie it with the
activity you are sending in the clear through them.

While this doesn't break your anonymity, the circle of suspect has
decreased from the entire world, a continent, or the country to a
region. This strongly hurts your anonymity. Keep as much information as
possible to yourself.

Prevent Tor over Tor scenarios.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Prevent Tor over Tor scenarios.")]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Whonix specific.**

When using a transparent proxy (Whonix includes one), it is possible to
start a Tor session from the client as well as from the transparent
proxy, creating a "Tor over Tor" scenario.

This happens when installing Tor inside Whonix-Workstation or when using
the Tor Browser Bundle without configuring it to use a SocksPort instead
of the TransPort. (Covered in the [Tor
Browser](/wiki/Tor_Browser "Tor Browser") article.)

Doing so produces undefined and potentially unsafe behavior. In theory,
however, you can get six hops instead of three, but it is not guaranteed
that you'll get three different hops - you could end up with the same
hops, maybe in reverse or mixed order. It is not clear if this is safe.
It has never been discussed.

You can choose an entry/exit point ^[[5]](#cite_note-5)^, but you get
the best security that Tor can provide when you leave the route
selection to Tor; overriding the entry / exit relays can mess up your
anonymity in ways we don't understand. Therefore Tor over Tor usage is
highly discouraged.

Don't send sensitive data without end-to-end encryption.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Don't send sensitive data without end-to-end encryption.")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As already explained on the [Warning](/wiki/Warning "Warning") page, Tor
exit relays can eavesdrop on communications and other Man-in-the-middle
attacks can happen. The only way to get sensitive data from the sender
to the recipient while withholding it from third parties, is using
end-to-end encryption.

Don't disclose identifying data about yourself.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Don't disclose identifying data about yourself.")]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

De-anonymization is not only possible with connections/IP addresses but
by social threats too. Some recommendations to avoid anonymization
collected by Anonymous:

-   Do not include personal information in your nickname
-   Do not discuss personal information, where you are from...
    discussions about something inane like the weather can give an
    accurate idea where you are located, over time.
-   Do not mention your gender, tattoos, piercings or physical
    capacities.
-   Do not mention your profession, hobbies or involvement in activist
    groups.
-   Do not use special characters on keyboard, which are existent only
    in your language.
-   Do not post information to the regular internet while you are
    anonymous. Do not use Twitter and Facebook. This is easy to
    correlate.
-   Do not post links to Facebook images. The image name contains a
    personal ID.
-   Do not connect to same destination at the same time. Try to
    alternate.
-   IRC, other chats, forum, mailing list, etc. are public, keep that in
    mind.
-   Do not discuss anything about yourself whatsoever even when securely
    and anonymously connecting to a group of strangers. You don't know
    who is on the other end or if they have been forced to work against
    you. It takes one informant to destroy a group.
-   Heroes only exist in comic books keep that in mind! There are only
    young heroes and dead heroes.

If it's a must to disclose identifying data about yourself, treat it as
"sensitive data" in the point above.

Do use bridges if you think Tor usage is dangerous/suspicious in your country.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Do use bridges if you think Tor usage is dangerous/suspicious in your country.")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quoted from the [Bridges](/wiki/Bridges "Bridges") page: "*Bridges are
important tools that work in many cases but they are **not an absolute
protection** against the technical progress that an adversary could do
to identify Tor users.*"

Don't maintain long term identities[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Don't maintain long term identities")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The longer you use the same pseudonym, the higher the probability that
you make mistakes that reveal your identity - which then allows an
adversary to go back and link all your activities. As a precaution
regularly create new identities and stop using old ones.

Don't use different online identities at the same time.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Don't use different online identities at the same time.")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They easily correlate. [Whonix doesn't magically separate your different
contextual
identities](/wiki/Warning#Whonix_doesn.27t_magically_separate_your_different_contextual_identities "Warning").

Also read the points below.

Don't log into Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. longer than necessary.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Don't log into Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. longer than necessary.")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Restrict the time your are logged in accounts for Twitter, Facebook,
Google and any other account based services (web forum etc.) to the time
you are using them. After you are done with reading, posting and so on,
log out. At least log out, shut down Tor Browser, change your Tor
circuit using a [Tor Controller](/wiki/Tor_Controller "Tor Controller"),
wait a few seconds until the circuit changed, restart Tor Browser. For
better security follow the [Recommendation to use multiple VM
Snapshots](/wiki/Security_Guide#Recommendation_to_use_multiple_VM_Snapshots "Security Guide")
and/or to [use multiple
Whonix-Workstations](/wiki/Multiple_Whonix-Workstations "Multiple Whonix-Workstations").

This is because many websites include one or more of the many
integration buttons, such as "I like" and "twitter this" and Google
analytics, adsense etc. Those buttons tell the originating service that
you visited that website because you were still logged into their
service.

Also note the chapter "Don't use different online identities at the same
time." above.

Do not mix Modes of Anonymity![[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Do not mix Modes of Anonymity!")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let us begin with an overview of the different Modes of Anonymity:

### mode(1): user anonymous; any recipient[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: mode(1): user anonymous; any recipient")]

-   Scenario: post anonymously a message in a message board/mailing
    list/comment field
-   Scenario: whistleblower and such
-   You are anonymous.
-   Your real IP/location stays hidden.
-   Location privacy: your location remains secret.

### mode(2): user knows recipient; both use Tor[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: mode(2): user knows recipient; both use Tor")]

-   Scenario: both sender and recipient know each other and both use
    Tor.
-   They can communicate with each other without any third party being
    wise to their activity or even to the knowledge that they are
    communicating with each other.
-   You are NOT anonymous.
-   Your real IP/location stays hidden.
-   Location privacy: your location remains secret.

### mode(3): user with no anonymity using Tor; any recipient[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: mode(3): user with no anonymity using Tor; any recipient")]

-   Scenario: login with your real name into any services, such as
    webmail, Twitter, Facebook, etc...
-   You are obviously NOT anonymous. As soon as you log into an account
    where you entered your real name the website knows your identity.
    Tor can not make you anonymous in these situations.
-   Your real IP/location stays hidden.
-   Location privacy. Your location remains secret.

### mode(4): user with no anonymity; any recipient[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: mode(4): user with no anonymity; any recipient")]

-   Scenario: normal browsing without Tor.
-   You are NOT anonymous.
-   Your real IP/location gets revealed.
-   Your location gets revealed.

### Conclusion[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Conclusion")]

It's not wise to combine mode(1) and mode(2). For example, if you have
an IM or email account and use that via mode(1), you are advised not to
use the same account for mode(2). We have explained previously why this
is an issue.

**It's also not wise to mix two or more modes inside the same Tor
session**, as they could share the same exit relay (identity
correlation).

It's also possible that other combinations of modes are dangerous and
could lead to the leakage of personal information or your physical
location.

Don't change settings if you don't know their consequences.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Don't change settings if you don't know their consequences.")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing user interface settings for applications, which do not connect
to the internet, mostly safe. For example, checking a box "don't show
this tip of the day anymore" or "hide this menu bar" will have no effect
on anonymity.

Look into the Whonix documentation, if changing the settings you are
interested in, is documented or recommended against; try to live with
the defaults.

Changing settings for applications, which connect to the internet, even
user interface settings, has to be thoroughly reviewed. For example
removing a menu bar or using Full Screen in Tor Browser is recommended
against. The latter is known to modify the screen size, which is bad for
the web fingerprint.

You should only modify network settings with great care if you know
their consequences. For example, you should stay away from the advice
related to "Firefox Tuning". If you believe the settings are suboptimal,
the changes should be proposed upstream, so they get changed for all Tor
Browser users with the next release.

Do not use clearnet and Tor at the same time.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Do not use clearnet and Tor at the same time.")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using your non-Tor browser and Tor Browser at the same time, risks that
you at some point confuse one for the other and deanonymize yourself.

Using clearnet and Tor at the same time also risks that you connect to a
server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time, which is
recommended against. The reason for this is explained in the point
below. You never know when you visit the same page anonymously and
non-anonymously at the same time, because you only see the url you're
visiting, not how many resources are fetched in background. Many
different websites are hosted in the same cloud. Services such as google
analytics are on the majority of all websites and therefore see a lot
anonymous and non-anonymous connections.

If you really want not to follow this recommendation, use at least two
different desktops to prevent confusing one browser for another.

Do not connect to any server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time![[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Do not connect to any server anonymously and non-anonymously at the same time!")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's highly recommended that you do not connect to any remote server in
this manner. That is, do not create a Tor link and a non-Tor link to the
same remote server at the same time. In the event your internet
connection breaks down (and it will eventually), all your connections
will break at the same time and it won't be hard for an adversary to put
the pieces together and determine what public IP/location belongs to
what Tor IP/connection, potentially identifying you directly. Another
attack a webserver could do is increasing or decreasing the speed of the
either non-Tor or Tor link and then see if there is a correlation of
either connection getting faster or slower, thereby concluding which
non-Tor link belongs to which Tor link.

Do not confuse Anonymity with Pseudonymity.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Do not confuse Anonymity with Pseudonymity.")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter explains the difference between anonymity and pseudonymity.
Word definitions are always a difficult topic because a majority of
people has to agree with it.

An anonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination
server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin
(IP/location) of that connection nor to associate and an identifier
^[[7]](#cite_note-identifier-7)^ to it.

A pseudonymous connection is defined as a connection to a destination
server, where the destination server has no means to find out the origin
(IP/location) of a connection, but can associate it with an identifier
^[[7]](#cite_note-identifier-7)^.

In an ideal world, the Tor network, Tor Browser (and the underlying
operating system, hardware, physical security, etc.) is perfect. For
example the user could fetch a news website and neither the news website
nor the website's ISP has any idea if that user has ever contacted the
news website before. ^[[8]](#cite_note-8)^

The opposite of this, when using software incorrectly, for example using
Firefox instead of the Tor-safe browser Tor Browser, the original
(IP/location) of a connection is still hidden, but an identifier (for
example Cookies) can be used to make that connection pseudonymous. The
destination website could log for example "user with id 111222333444
viewed video title a at time b on date c, video title d at time e at
date f.". These information can be used for profiling. Over time these
profiles become more and more comprehensive, which reduces anonymity,
i.e. in worst case it could lead to de-anonymization.

As soon as someone logs into a website (for example into a forum or
e-mail address) with a username the connection is by definition no
longer anonymous, but pseudonymous. The origin of the connection
(IP/location) is still hidden, but the connection can be associated with
an identifier ^[[7]](#cite_note-identifier-7)^, i.e. in this case, an
account name. Identifiers can be used to keep a log of various things.
When a user wrote what, date and time of login and logout, what a user
wrote, to whom the user wrote, IP address (useless, if it's a Tor exit
relay), browser fingerprint etc.

Maxim Kammerer, developer of Liberté Linux ^[[9]](#cite_note-9)^, has a
interesting different opinion. ^[[10]](#cite_note-10)^ I don't want to
withhold from you:

> I have not seen a compelling argument for anonymity, as opposed to
> pseudonymity. Enlarging anonymity sets is something that Tor
> developers do in order to publish incremental papers and justify
> funding. Most users only need to be pseudonymous, where their location
> is hidden. Having a unique browser does not magically uncover user's
> location, if that user does not use that browser for non-pseudonymous
> activities. Having good browser header results on anonymity checkers
> equally does not mean much, because there are many ways to uncover
> more client details (e.g., via Javascript oddities).

Don't be the first one to spread your own link.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Don't be the first one to spread your own link.")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You created an anonymous blog or hidden service? Great. You have a
twitter account with lots of followers, run a big clearnet news page or
similar? Great. Do not be tempted to be one of the first ones to
advertise your new anonymous project! The more you separate identities,
the better. Of course, at some point you may or even must be "naturally"
aware of it, but be very careful at this point.

Don't open random files or links.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Don't open random files or links.")]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Someone sent you an pdf by mail or gave you a link to a pdf? That
sender/mailbox/account/key could be compromised and the pdf could be
prepared to infect your system. Don't open it with the default tool you
were expected use with by the creator. For example, don't open a pdf
with a pdf viewer. If the content is public anyway, try using a free
online pdf viewer.

Don't do (mobile) phone verification.[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Don't do (mobile) phone verification.")]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Websites such as Google, Facebook and others will ask for a (mobile)
phone number if you login over Tor. Unless you are really clever or have
an alternative, you shouldn't do it.

Reason: The number you give away will be logged. The SIM card is most
likely registered on your name. And even if not, receiving an SMS gives
away your location. Even if you anonymously bought a SIM card and do it
from a point far away from your home, there is still a risk: the phone
itself. Each time the phone logs into the mobile network, the provider
will log the SIM card serial number ^[[11]](#cite_note-11)^ AND the
phone serial number ^[[12]](#cite_note-12)^. If you bought the SIM card
anonymously, but not the phone, it's not anonymous, because these two
serials will get linked. If you really want to do mobile verification,
you need a spot far away from your home, a fresh phone, and a fresh SIM
card. Afterwards, you must turn off the phone, and burn both the phone
and the SIM card right after doing it.

You could try to find an online service receiving SMS for you. That
would work and would be anonymous. The problem is, that it most likely
won't work for Google and Facebook, because they actively blacklist such
numbers for verification. Or you could try to find someone else
receiving the SMS for you, but that would only shift the risk from you
to the other person.

Why this page?[[edit](/w/index.php?title=DoNot&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Why this page?")]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can skip "*Why this page?*".

This page highly risks to state obvious things. Obvious to whom?
Developers, hackers, geeks, etc. may call that common sense.

Those groups tend to lose contact to actual non-techy users. It's good
sometimes to read usability papers or feedback from people who do not
post on mailing lists or in forums.

For example:
