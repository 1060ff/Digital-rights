"Protecting your keypair on a single device is not easy and it is always "
"possible your device gets stolen or lost. Encryption and signing are two "
"different operations.  They therefore demand two different key management "
"approaches.  You may want a signing key to be valid for a long time so "
"people around the world can check signatures from the past.  Regarding your "
"encryption key however, you would want to switch-over to new one’s sooner "
"and easily revoke/expire the old one.   Hence, keep your key-pair externally "
"as a ‘master keypair’ (for e.g., in a flash drive) and use a sub-key as a "
"‘local-key’ for signing messages is a good practice."
msgstr ""
"在一台单独的机器上保护好你的密钥对可能并不容易，但你的设备总有可能被偷或丢失。加密和签名是两种不同的操作，因此也需要区别出两种不同的密钥管理方式。你可能需要让你的签名密钥有很长的有效期，这样过去的朋友仍然能验证你的签名。但对于你的加密密钥，你会希望尽快换成一对新的并能轻松地撤回/过期旧的密钥（当你旧密钥丢了时）。此外，最好生成一对密钥作为“主密钥”，保存到外部存储（比如，U盘），再用这对“主密钥”生成一对子密钥（sub-key）放在本地机器日常使用。"

"Note: Keeping the primary secret key on removable media makes signing other "

"or new subkeys issued if they are allowed to expire. Also, people who use "
"your public key (i.e., to verify something you have signed) may receive "

"注意：把主私钥保存在外部介质上会让`GPG`密钥验证变得有点麻烦，因为每次对别人的密钥做验证时都需要把主密钥导入到本地环境。此外，如果给子密钥设置了过期日期（推荐如此）的话，那子密钥必须在过期日前续期，要么就重新签发子密钥。还有，使用了你的公钥的人（比如，要验证一些你签名了的东西）会收到关于你的密钥已经过期的报错，如果他们不经常从公共密钥服务器上更新他们的`GPG`密钥串的话。\n"
