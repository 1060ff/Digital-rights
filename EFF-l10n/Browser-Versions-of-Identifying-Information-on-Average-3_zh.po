"Whenever you visit a web page, your browser sends a \"User Agent\" header to "
"the website saying precisely which operating system and web browser you are "
"using. This information could help distinguish Internet users from one "
"another because these versions differ, often considerably, from person to "
"person. We recently ran an experiment to see to what extent this information "
"could be used to track people (for instance, if someone deletes their "
"browser cookies, would the User Agent, alone or in combination with some "
"other detail, be unique enough to let a site recognize them and re-create "
"their old cookie?)."

"Our experiment to date has shown that the browser [User "
"Agent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent) string usually carries 5-15 "
"bits of identifying information (about 10.5 bits on average). That means "
"that on average, only one person in about 1,500 (2<sup>10.5</sup>) will have "
"the same User Agent as you. On its own, that isn't enough to recreate "
"cookies and track people perfectly, but in combination with another detail "
"like geolocation to a particular ZIP code or having an uncommon browser "
"plugin installed, the User Agent string becomes a real privacy problem."

"It's not intuitively obvious that a User Agent poses a similar risk to a "
"unique tracking cookie. After all, cookies were designed, in part, to help "
"web sites distinguish and recognize individual browsers, and User Agents "
"weren't. And there could be millions of people out there who use the same "
"browser and operating system that you do. But let's examine the matter more "
"closely. A typical User Agent string looks something like this:"
