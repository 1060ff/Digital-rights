"Cookies are still a privacy problem for web users, many years after privacy "
"advocates first raised concerns about their use to track web browsing. "
"Today, cookies are one of the main mechanisms that advertising companies "
"like Google use to track and profile users across sites and over time -- "
"often building up a single gigantic profile for years and years. Many EFF "
"members respond to this threat by using their browsers' cookie management "
"features to limit which cookies they'll accept or how long they'll be "
"retained."

"But it turns out that the cookie situation is quite a bit trickier today, "
"and sites that want to track users have new technical options that are hard "
"for users to respond to. The traditional \"cookie\" is an [HTTP "
"cookie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie), invented by Lou Montulli "
"and John Giannandrea at Netscape in 1994. But today many browsers implement "
"a range of things with the same kind of cookie-like tracking behavior -- "
"mechanisms that are far less familiar, harder to notice, and often harder to "
"control."

"A great overview of the wide range of cookie technologies confronting us "
"today is [Cleaning Up After Cookies](https://www.isecpartners.com/files/iSEC_"
"Cleaning_Up_After_Cookies.pdf), an article published last year by Katherine "
"McKinley at [iSEC Partners](https://www.isecpartners.com/). McKinley "
"describes *five* cookie-like tracking methods that go beyond traditional "
"HTTP cookies, and explains how browsers often fail to let users exercise "
"meaningful control over these varieties of tracking."

"The most prominent of these tracking methods is the so-called \"Flash "
"cookie\", a kind of cookie maintained by the Adobe Flash plug-in on behalf "
"of Flash applications embedded in web pages.<a href=\"#footnote1_ipafzgs\" "
"id=\"footnoteref1_ipafzgs\" class=\"see-footnote\" title=\"Adobe refers to "
"Flash cookies as Local Shared Objects.  Aside from Flash cookies, the other "
"kinds of cookie-like objects McKinley identifies are HTML 5 DOM storage, "
"Microsoft Silverlight cookies, Microsoft Internet Explorer User Data "
"Persistence, and Google Gears data.\">1</a> These cookie files are stored "
"outside of the browser's control. Web browsers do not directly allow users "
"to view or delete the cookies stored by a Flash application, users are not "
"notified when such cookies are set, and these cookies never expire. Flash "
"cookies can track users in all the ways traditionally HTTP cookies do, and "
"they can be stored or retrieved whenever a user accesses a page containing a "
"Flash application. Some of the problems are "
"[highlighted](http://www.gnashdev.org/?q=node/62) by Rob Savoye, the "
"developer of [Gnash](http://www.gnashdev.org/), an open source Flash "
"implementation."

"Last month, a group of researchers at UC Berkeley led by Ashkan Soltani "
"released a study, [Flash Cookies and "
"Privacy](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1446862), about "
"this technology and the ways it's being used to track Internet users today. "
"The study found that Flash cookies are extensively used by popular sites, "
"and that most users probably don't know about them or how to delete them. "
"They also found that at least one major site uses them in a way that "
"violates the advertising industry's own rules on tracking."

"What's more, the Berkeley researchers found that Flash cookies are often "
"used to deliberately circumvent users' HTTP cookie policies. That is, a site "
"may intentionally store the *same information* redundantly in both HTTP "
"cookie and Flash cookie forms. When a user deletes the HTTP cookie, the site "
"may \"respawn\" it from the copy that was stored as a Flash cookie! It seems "
"clear that site operators know many users don't want to be tracked with "
"cookies, but have found a way of circumventing those users' privacy "
"preferences."

"These privacy-invasive marketing practices need [greater "
"scrutiny](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/08/behavioral-tracking). We need "
"more research to reveal whether the other kinds of cookies McKinley "
"described are also being used to track users, as Soltani and his "
"collaborators showed that Flash cookies are. It's entirely possible that "
"Flash cookies will turn out to be just the tip of the next-generation user "
"tracking iceberg."

"Meanwhile, browser developers should do more to let users understand and "
"control how they're being tracked -- using any of these techniques. "
"Unfortunately, Adobe has made that extremely difficult with regard to Flash "
"cookies, since they're stored outside of the browser's control, and since "
"the official Flash plug-in isn't open source, users can't easily fix this "
"for themselves. The [BetterPrivacy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-"
"US/firefox/addon/6623) Firefox plugin tries to address this by finding Flash "
"cookies on the hard drive and regularly deleting them, but Adobe could help "
"by ensuring their cookie system follows the browser's privacy settings.<a "
