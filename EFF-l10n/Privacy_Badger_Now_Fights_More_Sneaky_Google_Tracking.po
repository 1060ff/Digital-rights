"targeting Facebook’s use of this practice[1]. As it turns out, Google "

"the same style of tracking, both in web search and, more concerning, in "
"spaces \n"
"for private conversation like Hangouts and comments on Google Docs. From now "

"After you perform a web search, Google presents you with a list of results. "

"quick inspection, the links in the search results seem normal: hovering over "
"a \n"
"link to EFF’s website shows that the URL underneath does, in fact, point to "

"https://www.eff.org[2]. But once you click on the link, the page will fire "
"off \n"
"a request to google.com[3], letting the company know where you’re coming "

"In Chrome, its approach is fairly straightforward. The company uses the new "
"\n"
"HTML “ping” attribute[4], which is designed to perform exactly this kind of "
"\n"
"tracking. When you click on a link with a “ping” tag, your browser makes two "
"\n"
"requests: one to the website you want to go to, and another (in the "
"background)\n"
"to Google, containing the link you clicked and extra, encoded information[5] "
"\n"
"about the context of the page."

"Many users understand, even if they don’t like it, that Google provides "

"feels more private. Google provides the chat platform, but it doesn’t serve "

"there, and it shouldn’t have any business reading your messages. Knowing "

"the company is tracking the links you share, both when you send them and "
