"When ProtonMail first launched in 2014, our goal was to make email "
"encryption \n"
"ubiquitous by making it easy enough for anybody to use. This is no easy "
"feat[3],\n"
"and that’s probably why it had never been done before. Our guiding "
"philosophy is\n"
"that the most secure systems in the world don’t actually benefit society if "
"\n"
"nobody can use them, and because of this, we made a number of design "
"decisions \n"
"for the sake of better usability."
msgstr ""

#: Introducing_Address_Verification_and_Full_PGP_Support.txt:25
msgid ""
"One of these decisions was to make encryption key management automatic and \n"
"invisible to the user. While this made it possible for millions of people "
"around\n"
"the world to start using encrypted email without any understanding of what "
"an \n"
"encryption key is, the resulting architecture required a certain level of "
"trust \n"
"in ProtonMail."

"While a certain level of trust is always necessary when you use online "

"Prior to the introduction of Address Verification, if ProtonMail was \n"
"compromised, it would be possible to compromise user communications by "

"to the user a fake public encryption key. This could cause email "
"communications \n"
"to be encrypted in a way that an attacker, holding the corresponding fake \n"
"private key, could intercept and decrypt the messages (this is also known as "
"a \n"
"Man-in-the Middle attack, or MITM), despite the fact that the encryption "

"Address Verification provides an elegant solution to this problem. We "

"Address Verification works by leveraging the Encrypted Contacts[7] feature "
"that \n"
"we released previously. Starting with the latest version of ProtonMail, when "
"you\n"
"receive a message from a ProtonMail contact, you now have the option (in the "
"\n"
"ProtonMail web app) to Trust Public Keys for this contact. Doing so saves "
"the \n"
"public key for this contact into the digitally signed contacts, so it is not "
"\n"
"possible to tamper with the public encryption key once it has been trusted."

"for a malicious third party (even ProtonMail) to trick you into using a \n"

"already based upon PGP, and we maintain one of the world’s most widely used "

"expect most users to use. If you need secure email, the easiest and most "

"However, for the many out there who still use PGP, the launch of full PGP \n"
