"One of these decisions was to make encryption key management automatic and \n"
"invisible to the user. While this made it possible for millions of people "

"the world to start using encrypted email without any understanding of what "

"encryption key is, the resulting architecture required a certain level of "
"trust \n"
"in ProtonMail."
msgstr ""
"为了让加密邮件为广大使用者接受的原因 Protonmail 做的一个决定就是把很多的加解密操作步骤隐去了。"
"这样做虽然让数百万的人们用上了加密电邮而不需要懂任何密钥是什么，但这也意味着人们要给 Protonmail 一定程度的**信任**。"

"Prior to the introduction of Address Verification, if ProtonMail was \n"
"compromised, it would be possible to compromise user communications by "

"to be encrypted in a way that an attacker, holding the corresponding fake \n"
"private key, could intercept and decrypt the messages (this is also known as "

"在以前，如果 Proton被入侵了，攻击者可以给用户发送一个假的公钥（同时还得模仿或谎称这公钥就是你的发件人的——译者注），这样你跟发件人的通信虽然是端对端加密了但加密对象显然错了，攻击者可以用他自己的私钥解开你的加密邮件了（这也叫“中间人攻击，MITM）。"

"receive a message from a ProtonMail contact, you now have the option (in the "
"\n"
"ProtonMail web app) to Trust Public Keys for this contact. Doing so saves "

msgstr ""
"从最新版的 Protonmail 开始，当你收到你的联系人的邮件时，你能在（网页版）该发件人名的旁边见到「信任这个公钥」"
"(Trust Public Keys) 这样的选项。选择后系统就会保存该发件人的公钥并用你的私钥对这公钥进行数字签名。因此你一旦对该发件人的公钥表示信任（即签名）后，以后就看出这个公钥是否被篡改了。"
