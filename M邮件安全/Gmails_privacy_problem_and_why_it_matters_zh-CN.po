"Gmail faced a storm of criticism this week over its practice of sharing "

"The Wall Street Journal recently published an article highlighting privacy \n"
"concerns related to Gmail’s use of third-party apps[1]. When users install \n"
"tools known as “add-ons” in their Gmail accounts, they are often giving "
"outside\n"
"companies full access to their mailbox. In at least one instance, the WSJ \n"
"reported, “engineers personally read through thousands of emails“."

"In the public debate that followed, many people focused on Google’s poor \n"
"oversight of these third-party developers and the inadequacy of their "
"privacy \n"
"policies. While these are important concerns, they distract from the \n"
"fundamental problem with Google, which is that the company’s entire purpose "

"to spy on you and sell your private information to organizations that want "

"For an advertiser, your emails are a gold mine because we often think of "

"as a private communication channel. When your bank contacts you or you "

"Since 2014, Gmail has given third-party developers access to the platform’s "
"\n"
"API, which allows them to build software that can be used within the "

"By scanning your emails, companies can learn information about your email \n"

"the add-on developers sometimes shared redacted screenshots of entire "

"In one instance, two engineers read through 8,000 personal emails in order "
