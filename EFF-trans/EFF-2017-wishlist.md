## EFF's 2017 Wishlist
## EFF的2017願望清單

For the last five years, EFF has greeted the holiday season by publishing a list of things we'd like to see happen in the coming year. Sometimes these are actions we'd like to see taken by companies, and sometimes our wishes are aimed at governments, but we also include actions everyday people can take to advance our digital civil liberties. This year has seen a few victories, including the fact that more and more websites are using HTTPS by default and using Let's Encrypt (and our Certbot client for it), but there's always more to do. In 2017, we're narrowing our focus to technology companies and challenging them to step up and protect their users in what's likely to be a difficult year.

過去的五年，EFF都通過發佈一份我們希望在新的一年會發生的事情清單來歡度我們的假日。有時候這些是我們希望一些公司需要採取的行动，有时我们的目标指向政府，但我们也会囊括一些日常百姓都可以采取的提升我们公民自由的行动。今年我们看到些许胜利，包括越来越多的网站默认采用了 HTTPS，并使用 Let's Encrypt（还有我们的 Certbot 客户端）。但还是有很多需要去做。在2017年这个可能是更艰难的一年，我们将把我们的焦点缩窄在科技企业身上，鞭策他们更进一步保护他们的用户。

Here are some of the things EFF would like to see technology companies do in 2017:
以下就是EFF想要科技企业在2017年完成的一些事情：

-    Google should make it possible for users to enable 2-factor authentication without having to give the company their phone number, however briefly.
-    谷歌须让用户在启用二步验证时无需告诉它用户的手机号码，虽然这很方便。

-    Twitter should turn off the ability to reset your password over SMS when users enable 2-factor authentication.
-    推特须在用户启用二步验证时 关闭通过短信重置密码的功能。

-    Twitter should enable end-to-end encrypted direct messages.
-    推特须启用 端对端加密的直接信息（私信？）

-    Apple should enable some form of out-of-band verification for iMessage and Facetime.
-    苹果须启用 可以通过非自有设备的 iMessage和Facetime 的验证。

-    W3C members should back our call to protect accessibility, security research, and innovation in DRM standardization.
-    Google should stop mining the data they collect from students using Chromebooks for advertising.
-    谷歌须停止对使用 Chromebook 的学生的数据挖掘，用于广告。

-    Facebook should stop making itself an arbiter of "authentic names" and allow people to use whatever name they want on their account.
-    脸书须停止对 “真实姓名”的仲裁，并允许用户对自己的帐号使用任意他们想要的用户名。

-    WhatsApp should continue to allow users to opt out of data-sharing with their parent company, Facebook. Currently, the opt-out deadline has passed and new WhatsApp accounts do not have the option of opting out of data-sharing at all.
-    Whatsapp 须继续允许用户可以选择不与它的母公司脸书 进行数据分享。当前，这个选项已经没有了，新注册的用户必须选择全盘与脸书数据分享。

We'll be keeping track of these companies over the year to see which of these wishes come true, so stay tuned. This blog post is part of a campaign asking the technology community to defend users and digital rights.
